Competed in a one-on-one robotics competition using the TurtleBot3 robot in a predefined playground.
Implemented motion planning and obstacle avoidance strategies for autonomous robot navigation.
Developed traditional image processing techniques to detect balls and guide the robot in pushing them out of the arena, functioning like a goalkeeper.
